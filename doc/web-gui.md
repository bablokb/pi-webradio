Web-GUI
=======

The web-GUI is organized in vertical tabs accessible from icons on
the left. Although the layout is responsive, it is best viewed in
landscape mode.

Each tab serves a certain purpose, e.g. channel selection or playback:

![main-page (clock)](clock.png)
![channel list](channels.png)
![channel playback](play_channel.png)
![file playback](play_file.png)
![system functions](special.png)
