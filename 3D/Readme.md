3D Models of the Case
=====================

All STL-files were printed using PLA (Das Filament) on a Prusa MK3S
with setting "0.2mm quality".

Designed and printed from Tinkercad:

Tinkercad has performance-problems with a design composed of so many
parts, so I switched to OpenSCAD and retrofitted the case. This is the
reason that the scad-code is not as parametrized as it actually should
be. Being new to OpenSCAD I also assume there are better ways to
implement the various sub-parts.

Tolerances are very tight (especially for the connectors), so test
the print of critical parts to see if they actually fit to your components.
Printing took 10:08h.
